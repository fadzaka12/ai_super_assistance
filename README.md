# AI Super Assistance

**AI Super Assistance** is an offline personal assistant that runs entirely on your own PC, giving you full control over your data. It listens for a wake word, converts your speech to text, executes the request through low‑code n8n workflows powered by local LLMs, and replies with a natural voice. 

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fadzaka12/ai_super_assistance.git
cd ai_super_assistance
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```
